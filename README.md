# Safety-Focused-Route-Planning-Web-Application
Safety-Focused Route Planning Web Application – A real-time web application that provides safety-aware route recommendations by integrating live location tracking with map-based navigation, prioritizing user safety over shortest-path routing.
This project was developed as part of CMR Hackfest 3.0, held at CMR College of Engineering & Technology, Hyderabad.

🛡️ Project Overview

We built a real-time, safety-focused route planning web application designed to help users choose safer paths and navigate with confidence. The system integrates:
Live location tracking
Real-world map-based routing
Safety-oriented decision logic
User-centric navigation features
The primary goal is to enhance user security during travel, especially in unfamiliar or high-risk areas.

🧠 Hackathon Experience

Although our team didn’t secure a prize, the hackathon journey was highly rewarding. From ideation and rapid prototyping to late-night debugging and final presentation, the experience pushed us to think critically and build under real-world constraints.

Key takeaways:
Hands-on experience with real-time web technologies
Strong collaboration and teamwork
Practical problem-solving under time pressure
Exposure to end-to-end product development

🙏 Acknowledgements
Grateful to my teammates, mentors, and the organizers of CMR Hackfest 3.0 for providing an excellent platform to learn, build, and grow.
